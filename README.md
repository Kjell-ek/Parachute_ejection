# Parachute_ejection

Code for self edjecting parachute. The code read the data from the Pmod ACL2 accelerometer component. A level shifter is nessesary to convert the logic level of the     accelerometer (3V) to the logic level of the Aurdino Uno (5V). When the accelerometer sences that it is in free fall the servo is activated releasing the parachute.
Once Wiring is comple, calibration is done with the help by changing the calibration values in the begining of the code.
